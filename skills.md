In terms of programming, my mother tongue is Java where I have the most expertise by conducting different projects including and Android app. During my cursus I have studied many programming langauges such as C, Scala and Python which is by far my favourite :). I also did some Shell, Bash and Perl scripting. For a database course project we did a web application using HTML/CSS, Django and PostgreSQL.
